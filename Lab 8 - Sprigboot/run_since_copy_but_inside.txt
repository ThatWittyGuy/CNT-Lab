Yes, copying to a new folder is okay in most cases. It will only give errors if paths/ports/configs inside the projects still point to the old locations, but usually Maven + Node projects work fine after moving.[1][4]

## Folder setup idea

Do this to keep things clear:

- Create one parent folder, for example: `E:\college-project\`
- Inside it, put:
  - `result-service`  (backend Spring Boot project)
  - `college-frontend` (frontend Vite/React project)
- Do NOT mix their files into one single project folder; keep them as two separate subfolders. This matches the commands your teacher gave.[4]

So your paths would be something like:
- `E:\college-project\result-service\`
- `E:\college-project\college-frontend\`

## Step 1 – Start XAMPP

- Open XAMPP Control Panel.
- Click “Start” for Apache.
- Click “Start” for MySQL.
- Make sure there are no port conflicts (for example with IIS, Skype, etc.).[1][4]

## Step 2 – Run result-service (backend)

1) Open a terminal/PowerShell.  
2) Go to the result-service folder (update the path to your new location), for example:

- `cd "E:\college-project\result-service"`

3) Run the Spring Boot app:

- `.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run`

This uses the wrapper inside that folder, so the folder path must be correct and must contain `mvnw.cmd`, `pom.xml`, and the `src` folder.[4]

If you get an error after moving:

- If the error says “mvnw.cmd not found”, you are in the wrong folder.
- If the error is about database connection (for example cannot connect to MySQL), check:
  - `application.properties` or `application.yml` inside `src/main/resources/`
  - Confirm that the DB name, user, and password exist in XAMPP’s MySQL.[1][4]

## Step 3 – Run college-frontend (frontend)

1) Open a second terminal/PowerShell.  
2) Go to the frontend folder:

- `cd "E:\college-project\college-frontend"`

3) Install dependencies once (if `node_modules` got deleted or this is a fresh copy):

- `npm install`

4) Start dev server:

- `npm run dev`

Vite will show something like:

- Local: http://localhost:5173/

Open that URL in the browser.[4]
